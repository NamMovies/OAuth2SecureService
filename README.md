## Introduction

OAuth2SecureService provides a secure way to manage user authentication and authorization. It allows client applications to request access tokens for users and enables resource servers to validate these tokens. The service is designed with security in mind, ensuring that sensitive data is handled safely.

## Features

- **OAuth2 Authorization Server**: Manage user authentication and token issuance.
- **Federated Tokens**: Support for tokens from multiple identity providers.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Reliable and scalable database solution.
- **HTTPS Support**: Ensures secure data transmission.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular design for better scalability and maintenance.
- **Google Login Integration**: Simplifies user authentication with Google accounts.
- **Comprehensive API**: Easy to use for client applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language.
- **Spring Security**: Framework for securing applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database management system.
- **OAuth2**: Protocol for authorization.
- **OIDC**: OpenID Connect for user authentication.
- **Microservices**: Architectural style for building applications as a collection of loosely coupled services.

   ```

4. **Download Latest Release**:  
   Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/NamMovies/OAuth2SecureService/releases) and execute the required files.

## Configuration

To configure the OAuth2SecureService, you will need to set up the application properties. This file is typically located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`. Here are the key properties to configure:

```properties
# Server Configuration
server.port=8080
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.p12
server.ssl.key-store-password=yourpassword
server.ssl.keyStoreType=PKCS12

# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdbname
spring.datasource.username=yourusername
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# OAuth2 Configuration
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=your-client-id
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=your-client-secret
```

### Setting Up PostgreSQL

1. **Install PostgreSQL**:  
   Make sure PostgreSQL is installed on your machine.

2. **Create Database**:  
   Create a new database for the application:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE yourdbname;
   ```

3. **Set Up User**:  
   Create a user and grant permissions:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER yourusername WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE yourdbname TO yourusername;
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can start using it to manage user authentication and authorization. The service exposes various endpoints for client applications to interact with.

### Starting the Application

Run the application using your IDE or through the command line with the following command:

```bash
java -jar target/OAuth2SecureService-1.0.0.jar
```

### Accessing the API

You can access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL. Below are some common operations you can perform:

1. **Obtain Access Token**:  
   Send a POST request to the token endpoint:
   ```http
   POST /oauth/token
   ```

2. **Authenticate User**:  
   Use the `/login` endpoint to authenticate users.

3. **Access Protected Resources**:  
   Use the access token to access protected resources.

## API Endpoints

Here are some key API endpoints available in OAuth2SecureService:

| Method | Endpoint                      | Description                        |
|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/oauth/token`                | Obtain an access token             |
| POST   | `/login`                      | Authenticate a user                |
| GET    | `/api/resource`               | Access protected resource           |
| GET    | `/api/user`                   | Get user details                   |
